# E-Commerce Web Application – Testing & QA

**Objective:** Validate core user journeys (browse → add-to-cart → checkout) for a demo e-commerce app, 
ensuring functional, integration, and system-level quality.

## Tools
- JIRA (bug tracking), Bugzilla (defect lifecycle), Excel (test design), Markdown (reports)

## How to Use
1. Open `TestCases.xlsx` for all test scenarios with steps, data, and expected results.
2. Review `BugReport_JIRA.csv` for sample logged defects with severity/priority.
3. Read `UAT_Report.md` for acceptance criteria and sign‑off notes.
4. See `Screenshots/` for execution evidence (placeholders included).

## Scope
- Functional testing of Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation.
- Integration testing for payment and order services.
- System testing for performance smoke and basic security checks.

## Notes
- These are realistic, **portfolio-ready** artifacts designed to reflect real QA process and documentation.
